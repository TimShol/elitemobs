## The Tier System

EliteMobs classifies enemies into 5 tiers of power. These tiers determine an entity's health, damage output, equipment quality, and ability access.

| Tier | Name | Color Indicator | Challenge Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Common | `[•]` | Baseline challenge, slightly stronger than vanilla. |
| **2** | Uncommon | `[• •]` | Noticeable threat, often has basic abilities. |
| **3** | Rare | `[• • •]` | dangerous, requires decent gear. |
| **4** | Epic | `[• • • •]` | Mini-boss difficulty, high chance of ability use. |
| **5** | Legendary | `[• • • • •]` | Boss-level threat, best loot, maximum size. |

## Progression Styles

The mod decides *where* high-tier mobs spawn based on the `progressionStyle` setting in `core.yml`.

### 1. Environment (Default)
Tiers are tied to Hytale's zone difficulty.
*   **Zone 1 (Green):** Mostly T1/T2.
*   **Zone 2 (Yellow):** Mix of T2/T3.
*   **Zone 3 (Red):** Heavy on T3/T4.
*   **Zone 4 (Devastated):** Dangerous T4/T5 spawns.

### 2. Distance from Spawn
Difficulty scales linearly as you travel further from coordinates `(0,0)`.
*   **Near Spawn:** Safe, mostly vanilla or T1.
*   **Deep Wilderness:** Tiers gradually increase every ~1000 blocks (configurable).
*   **Bonus Stats:** Mobs gain small health/damage bonuses every ~100 blocks between tier jumps, creating a smooth difficulty curve.

### 3. None (Random)
A truly chaotic mode where any tier can spawn anywhere based on global weights. Good for hardcore survival servers.

## Combat Mechanics

### Abilities
Elites aren't just stat sponges. Depending on their tier and type, they can:
*   **Leap:** Close the distance instantly with a physics-based slam.
*   **Heal:** Drink potions during combat if not interrupted.
*   **Summon:** Call reinforcements (e.g., Skeleton Archers) to overwhelm players.

### Scaling
*   **Health:** Multiplied per tier (e.g., Tier 5 might have 2.6x base health).
*   **Damage:** Multiplied per tier (e.g., Tier 5 deals 2.6x damage).
*   **Size:** Higher tiers are physically larger (up to +18% scale).

## Loot System
Elites drop vanilla loot with multipliers (e.g., 4x drops) and have a chance to drop their equipped gear.
*   **Equipment:** Weapons and armor roll with rarities (Common to Legendary) matching the mob's tier.
*   **Custom Drops:** You can configure rare items (essences, gems) to drop only from specific tiers.
