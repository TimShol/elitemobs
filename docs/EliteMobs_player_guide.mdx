EliteMobs was built to change combat by introducing elite NPC variants with stronger stats, special mechanics, and improved rewards.

## Spotting Elites

- **Nameplates**: Elites have tiered nameplate prefixes and family-specific titles.
- **Size**: Optional model scaling makes higher-tier elites larger.
- **Combat text**: Damage numbers are shown more clearly and stand out during fights.

## Combat Differences

- **Higher health and damage**: Tiers scale max health and damage output.
- **Abilities**: Elites can leap, heal, resist damage, or summon allies depending on tier.
- **Effects**: High-tier elites can gain resistances such as projectile resistance.

## Rewards

Elites can drop:
- Better weapons and armor
- Extra materials and tiered loot
- Chance to drop equipped items

## Tips

- Focus on mobility when fighting leap abilities.
- Use interrupts or burst damage against healers.
- Treat Tier 4 and Tier 5 elites like mini-boss encounters.
