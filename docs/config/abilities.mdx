Abilities make Elites dangerous. `abilities.yml` defines what abilities exist, who can use them, and how powerful they are per tier.

## Ability Structure

Each ability (Charge Leap, Heal, Summon) has common fields:

*   `isEnabled`: Global toggle.
*   `chancePerTier`: Probability an Elite of this tier gets the ability.
*   `cooldownSecondsPerTier`: How often it can be used.
*   `gate`: Restrictions on who can use it (e.g., "Must hold a sword", "Cannot be a Void Eye").

## Charge Leap

Propels the mob toward the player to close distance.

```yaml
charge_leap:
  slamBaseDamagePerTier: [0, 0, 0, 20, 30] # Damage on impact
  applyForcePerTier: [0, 0, 0, 530, 530]   # Velocity force
```

## Heal Potion

Allows the mob to drink a potion when low on health.

```yaml
heal_potion:
  minHealthTriggerPercent: 0.50 # Triggers below 50% HP
  instantHealChance: 1.0        # vs Regeneration
  npcDrinkDurationSeconds: 3.0  # Time to interrupt
```

## Undead Summon

Summons reinforcements (usually Skeleton Archers) during combat.

```yaml
undead_summon:
  maxAlive: 7                   # Max minions at once
  skeletonArcherWeight: 100     # Summon pool weight
```
