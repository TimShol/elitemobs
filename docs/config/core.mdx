title: Core Settings (core.yml)
description: Global settings for spawning, diagnostics, reconciliation, and compatibility.
---

EliteMobs was built with global systems defined in `core.yml`. These settings affect how elites spawn, how the mod behaves during reloads, and diagnostic output.

## System

```yaml
System:
  configVersion: "1.1.0"
```

This is auto-managed. You should not edit it.

## Reconcile

Reconcile updates existing elites after a config reload.

```yaml
Reconcile:
  announceReconcile: true
  reconcileWindowTicks: 40
```

- `reconcileWindowTicks`: ticks to re-apply features to existing elites after reload. `0` disables.
- `announceReconcile`: logs when reconcile starts and ends.

## Debug

```yaml
Debug:
  isDebugModeEnabled: true
  debugMobRuleScanIntervalSeconds: 5
```

Enables extra logs for spawn scans and ability decisions. The scan interval controls how often NPCs are evaluated against mob rules.

## Compatibility Messages

```yaml
Compat:
  showCompatJoinMessages: true
```

Shows compatibility messages when players join, useful for identifying active integrations.

## Spawning

Spawning logic remains in `core.yml`. See [Spawning](/EliteMobs_spawning) for full details.

## Health & Damage Scaling

These have been moved to `stats.yml`.

## Gear & Asset Generation

Gear durability and catalogs have been moved to `gear.yml`. Asset generator naming has been moved to `visuals.yml`.
