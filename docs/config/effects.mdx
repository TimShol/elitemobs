`effects.yml` controls the passive buffs and visual particle effects applied to EliteMobs.

## Projectile Resistance

This effect gives Elites resistance against ranged attacks (bows, crossbows).

```yaml
EFFECT_PROJECTILE_RESISTANCE:
  isEnabled: true
  # Percentage of resistance per tier (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Tier 4 gets 70% resistance, Tier 5 gets 85%
  amountMultiplierPerTier: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.85]
  infinite: true
```

*   **Tip:** If you find the particle effects for this resistance visually overwhelming, you can set `isEnabled: false` to disable both the mechanics and the visuals.
