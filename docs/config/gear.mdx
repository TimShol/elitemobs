title: Gear Configuration
description: Managing equipment catalogs, durability, and restrictions in gear.yml.
---

`gear.yml` (formerly `catalogs.yml`) defines what items Elites can wear and how powerful those items are.

## Durability

Controls the condition of gear when it spawns (and potentially drops).

```yaml
Gear:
  spawnGearDurabilityMin: 0.02 # 2% durability
  spawnGearDurabilityMax: 0.30 # 30% durability
```

## Two-Handed Logic

Prevents mobs from dual-wielding items that logically require two hands (like bows or heavy axes) with a shield.

```yaml
Gear:
  twoHandedWeaponIds:
    - "shortbow"
    - "crossbow"
    - "spear"
    - "battleaxe"
```

## Catalogs & Rarity

This section maps item keywords to rarities. For example, if a weapon ID contains "rusty", it is treated as "common".

```yaml
Gear:
  # Maps keyword -> rarity
  weaponRarityRulesContains:
    "rusty": "common"
    "void": "epic"
    "flame": "legendary"

  # Which tiers can wear which rarities
  tierAllowedRarities:
    - ["common"]              # Tier 1
    - ["uncommon"]            # Tier 2
    - ["rare"]                # Tier 3
    - ["epic"]                # Tier 4
    - ["epic", "legendary"]   # Tier 5
```

## Equipment Lists

The `weaponCatalog` and `armorMaterials` lists are the "database" the mod draws from when equipping mobs. If you add modded items to Hytale, add their IDs here so Elites can use them.
