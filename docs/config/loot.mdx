`loot.yml` (formerly `drops.yml`) controls the rewards players receive for defeating Elites.

## Equipment Drop Chances

These settings control how likely an Elite is to drop the actual gear it is wearing.

```yaml
Loot:
  dropWeaponChance: 0.05       # 5% chance
  dropArmorPieceChance: 0.05   # 5% chance per piece
  dropOffhandItemChance: 0.05  # 5% chance (shield/torch)
```

## Vanilla Multipliers

Multiplies the standard loot table (bones, flesh, etc.) by the mob's tier.

```yaml
Loot:
  # Multiplier per tier (Tier 1 to Tier 5)
  vanillaDroplistMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0  # Tier 1 (Vanilla amount)
    - 0  # Tier 2
    - 2  # Tier 3 (2x drops)
    - 4  # Tier 4 (4x drops)
    - 6  # Tier 5 (6x drops)
```

## Extra Drops

Custom drop tables for specific tiers. You can add rare materials, potions, or currency items here.

```yaml
Loot:
  extraDrops:
    - itemId: "Potion_Health_Greater"
      chance: 0.12        # 12% drop chance
      minTier: 4          # Only drops from Tier 4+
      maxTier: 4
      minAmount: 1
      maxAmount: 2
```
