description: Tuning health and damage multipliers in stats.yml.
---

`stats.yml` controls the raw math behind Elite difficulty. This is where you adjust how "spongy" or "deadly" the mobs are.

## Health Scaling

Controls the maximum health of EliteMobs relative to their vanilla counterparts.

```yaml
Health:
  enableHealthScaling: true
  # Multipliers for Tier 1 to Tier 5
  healthMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.1  # Tier 1 (1.1x total health)
    - 0.5  # Tier 2 (1.5x total health)
    - 1.1  # Tier 3 (2.1x total health)
    - 1.8  # Tier 4 (2.8x total health)
    - 2.6  # Tier 5 (3.6x total health)
```

## Damage Scaling

Controls the physical damage output.

```yaml
Damage:
  enableMobDamageMultiplier: true
  # Damage multipliers for Tier 1 to Tier 5
  mobDamageMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.6
    - 1.1
    - 1.6
    - 2.1
    - 2.6
  # Randomness factor (+/- 5%) to make hits feel less static
  mobDamageRandomVariance: 0.05
```

**Tip:** If you feel Tier 1 mobs are too weak, increase the first value in `healthMultiplierPerTier`. If Tier 5 mobs one-shot players, lower the last value in `mobDamageMultiplierPerTier`.
