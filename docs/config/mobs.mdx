title: Mobs Configuration
description: Overriding specific NPC behaviors in mobs.yml.

`mobs.yml` allows you to define specific rules for individual NPC types (e.g., "Goblin Duke" vs "Goblin Miner").

## Mob Rules

A Mob Rule tells the system how to handle a specific Entity ID found in the world.

```yaml
Mobs:
  rules:
    Goblin_Miner:
      # Is this mob allowed to be Elite?
      enabledPerTier: [true, true, true, true, true]
      
      # Force it to only use pickaxes
      weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
      weaponIdMustContain: ["pickaxe"]
      
    Trork_Shaman:
      # Force it to only use staffs
      weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
      weaponIdMustContain: ["staff"]
```

### Weapon Logic
*   **ALWAYS:** Forces the mob to equip an item matching the criteria, replacing whatever it had.
*   **ONLY_IF_EMPTY:** Only equips an item if the mob has empty hands.
*   **NONE:** Never changes the mob's equipment (good for custom bosses or unarmed mobs).
