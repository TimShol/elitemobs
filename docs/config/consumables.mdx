description: Configuring potion and food behavior in consumables.yml.

`consumables.yml` defines how items consumed by Elites behave. This is primarily used by the **Heal Potion** ability.

## Potion Behavior

When an Elite drinks a potion, these settings control the animation duration and movement penalty.

```yaml
Consumables:
  byId:
    EliteMobs_Consumable_Big_Potions:
      # Movement speed multiplier while drinking (0.7 = 30% slow)
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      # Duration in seconds to finish drinking
      consumeDuration: 1.8
      
    EliteMobs_Consumable_Small_Potions:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.2
```

These IDs correspond to the internal asset tags used by the ability system.
