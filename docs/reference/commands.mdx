## Admin Commands

Requires operator permissions.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/elitemobs reload` | Reloads all YAML configurations from disk. Updates spawn logic immediately; existing entities may not update until respawn. |
| `/npc clean` | **Dangerous.** Removes all Elite entities from the world. Useful for uninstalling or debugging. Use `--confirm` to execute. |

## Permissions

Currently, EliteMobs commands default to OP-only. A permission node system will be added in a future update for mod-compatible permission managers.
