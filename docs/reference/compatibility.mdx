EliteMobs is designed to be compatible with standard Hytale modding practices.

## RPG Leveling Mods
EliteMobs includes internal logic to detect popular leveling mods. When detected, it may attempt to align its Tier system with the external Level system for nameplate consistency.

## Custom Item Mods
If you have a mod that adds new weapons (e.g., `SpartanWeaponry_Longsword_Iron`), you must manually add these IDs to `gear.yml` in the `weaponCatalog`. If you don't, Elites will never roll them.

## World Generation Mods
The `ENVIRONMENT` progression style relies on standard Hytale biome/zone tags. If a custom biome mod does not apply standard tags (e.g., `Zone1`), Elites may default to Tier 1 spawning rules. Use `progressionStyle: DISTANCE_FROM_SPAWN` for better compatibility with custom maps.
