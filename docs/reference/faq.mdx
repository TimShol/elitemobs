## Troubleshooting

### Why aren't elites spawning?
1.  Check `core.yml` -> `globalSpawnChance` (default is 0.15 or 15%).
2.  If using `ENVIRONMENT` progression, ensure you are in a supported zone (Zone 1-4).
3.  Check server logs for parsing errors on startup.

### Why are mobs one-shotting me?
Check `stats.yml` -> `mobDamageMultiplierPerTier`. The default scaling for Tier 5 is quite high (2.6x). If you have mods that increase vanilla armor values, this is fine, but for vanilla Hytale, you might want to lower it to 2.0x.

### How do I remove the mod safely?
1.  Run `/npc clean --confirm` to remove existing Elite entities.
2.  Stop the server.
3.  Remove the JAR file.
4.  Restart.

*Note: If you skip step 1, you may have "ghost" entities with broken AI or rendering issues until they are naturally killed.*

## Configuration

### Can I make elites spawn everywhere?
Yes. Set `progressionStyle: NONE` in `core.yml`. This randomizes tiers regardless of location.

### How do I disable the particles?
Particle effects are tied to the status effects in `effects.yml`. You can disable `EFFECT_PROJECTILE_RESISTANCE` if it's visually noisy.
