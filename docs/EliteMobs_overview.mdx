# Overview

EliteMobs was built to introduce elite variants of standard NPCs. Elites are organized into tiers that determine how strong they are, how they look, and what they drop. Higher tiers are rarer and more dangerous.

## Feature Categories

- **Combat**: tiered health and damage scaling, ability mechanics, and clearer damage numbers.
- **Loot & Gear**: tiered gear equips, rarity rules, and extra drop tables.
- **Visual Identity**: nameplates, tier prefixes, and optional model scaling.
- **Systems**: runtime reloads, asset generation, and environment-based spawn rules.

## Tier Distribution

Global tier chances are defined in `main.yml`:

```yaml
Spawning:
  spawnChancePerTier:
    - 0.46
    - 0.28
    - 0.16
    - 0.08
    - 0.04
```

## Scaling

Health and damage scaling are defined in `main.yml`:

```yaml
Health:
  enableHealthScaling: true
  healthMultiplierPerTier: [0.1, 0.5, 1.1, 1.8, 2.6]

Damage:
  enableMobDamageMultiplier: true
  mobDamageMultiplierPerTier: [0.6, 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, 2.6]
  mobDamageRandomVariance: 0.05
```

## Visual Identity

Nameplates and tier prefixes are configured in `visuals.yml`, and model scaling can be enabled to make elites feel physically imposing.
